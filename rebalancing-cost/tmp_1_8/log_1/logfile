(SanityCheck) one of the dimensions of the smallest atomic block is less than 16.
  This can be inefficient. For the best performance we recommend between 20^3 to 25^3 blocks.
  It is recommended to adjust the number of processors or the sparseBlockStructure, and making sure that the particleEnvelope is smaller than the block size.
